## 1. Idea

So I came late to American Football, but ever since [Prosieben MAXX](https://www.prosiebenmaxx.de/) started broadcasting [ranNFL](https://www.ran.de/us-sport/nfl) live here in Germany I was hooked!

Why make this bot? Well the guys from [ranNFL](https://www.ran.de/us-sport/nfl) gave a shoutout to vote for our German special teamer **Mark Nzeocha** to make the Pro Bowl. I voted, obviously! But my fingers started to get tired pressing the buttons one after another, so here we are! You can now vote how often you want without doing anything but starting a console application.

## 2. Usage

The console application is pretty simple to use, just download the `ProBowlVotingBot.zip` from the release tab, unzip the folder, start a console in the folder you unzipped the files in and type the following:

```bash
ProBowlVotingBot.exe --position ST --name "mark zeocha"
```

With the above command the bot will download a local Chromium install it and then open it to do it's *magic*!

Of course you can specify any valid position and name from the voting cast. And if you don't need to see what is going on you can hide the browser!

```bash
ProBowlVotingBot.exe --position QB --name "patrick mahomes" --show false
```

**Have fun voting!**  üó≥Ô∏èüèà
